Roadmap for 2025
################

Gora is always working to improve its core product as well as cater for new
market demands. In 2025, we plan to accomplish the following goals:

************************
Browser-based Gora nodes
************************

Currently running a Gora node requires a Linux server or an AWS cloud account.
Soon we will make it possible with any Javascript-enabled web browser. This will
allow anyone with a web3 wallet to instantly become a node operator, earning
rewards and strengthening the distributed nature of Gora node networks. ASO
customers will be able to get started much more easily with their own node
networks too. We have been working on making our node software codebase
browser-compatible for a while and we are now finalizing this work.

**************
Solana support
**************

Solana usage has grown tremendously in recent times. We are now building
proof-of-concept implementations of our key components and will soon be prepared
to fully tap into that ecosystem.

***************
Gora mobile app
***************

Building on the platform-agnostic nature of our revamped codebase, we are
planning a React Native superapp. It will provide a single point of control
for all Gora functions: a local Gora node, Gora-specific blockchain explorer,
ASO control panel and server node deployments manager. Apart from user
convenience, it will bring some unique opportunities such as direct feeding
sensor data from any IOT or mobile device into blockchain.

*****************************
Automated executor deployment
*****************************

Currently ASO customers willing to deploy their own executor oracles must
follow a semi-manual process with the help of our staff. We are planning to
make it fully automated using a factory smart contract.
