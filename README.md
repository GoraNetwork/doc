# Project Phoenix documentation

Customer-facing documentation for project Phoenix. Document text sources files
are in reStructuredText format. Diagrams are in OpenOffice ODG format and must
be manually exported to SVG for inclusion after updates. To produce HTML, make
sure that `rst2html5.py` is installed (usually a part of `docutils` package),
then run `make`. See `Makefile` for export options and paths.
