Gora enables blockchain applications to interact with the outside world. Getting
financial information from high-quality providers, extracting arbitrary data
from public pages, calling online APIs or running arbitrary Web Assembly code
off-chain - is all made possible by Gora. To maintain security and trust, Gora
relies on decentralization. A network of independent Gora nodes executes
requested operations in parallel and certifies the outcome via reliable
consensus procedure.

Use this page as a starting point for discovering Gora products and their API's,
becoming a Gora node operator or an owner of an application-specific oracle - a
custom blockchain oracle tailored to your needs.  Peruse the links below for
