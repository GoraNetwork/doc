            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><a href="https://gora.io/">Gora</a> enables blockchain programs (smart contracts) to interact with the outside world. Getting financial information from high-quality providers, extracting arbitrary data from public pages, calling online APIs or running Web Assembly code off-chain - is all made possible by Gora. To maintain security and trust, Gora relies on decentralization. A network of independent Gora nodes executes requested operations in parallel and certifies the outcome via reliable consensus procedure.</p>
            <figure align="left">

            </figure>
            <p>Customers interact with Gora in one of three roles: investor, node operator or smart contract developer. An investor purchases Gora tokens and delegates them to a node operator, receiving a share of rewards accrued from processing Gora requests. A node operator stakes Gora tokens (their own or investor's) and runs Gora Node Runner software to process Gora requests and receive rewards in Gora tokens. A smart contract developer writes applications that make use of Gora smart contract API's.</p>
            <p>This document is aimed mainly at developers or node operators. Software engineers working with Gora-enabled blockchains, as well as companies interested in adding an oracle to blockchains they manage, will find technical information here. For Gora node operators, instructions and background information are also provided. Most recent and relevant products are described first, followed by info on legacy offerings.</p>

            <h2>App-specific Oracles (ASO's)</h2>
            <p>App-specific oracles (<em>ASO</em>'s) are Gora's response to recent market demands. These are oracles designed to serve a certain web3 application or application type. While a general-purpose oracle strives for maximum flexibility to support all kinds or applications, it may lack specialized data processing or access control features needed for more niche use cases. For example, a sports oracle may want to provide team statistics which requires getting data from several resources and performing floating-point maths on it. A private oracle may want to only serve specific smart contracts or authenticate itself to data sources in a bespoke way.</p>

            <p>Gora provides accesible and flexible tools to create your own ASO's and deploy them to EVM-compatible blockchains of your choice: either public, like Base or Polygon, or private, which organizations can run internally. Gora does this by combining its tried and true general-purpose oracle architecture with a powerful off-chain computation engine. Rather than simply fetching data online and passing it on for verification, Gora ASO requests execute <em>oracle programs</em>: tiny pieces of software that implement customizations and extensions to oracle functionality. Oracle programs can be easily created by customers deploying ASO's using programming languages of their choice.</p>
            <section id="aso-architecture-and-workflow">
                <h3>ASO architecture and workflow</h3>

                </figure>
                <p>Gora's app-specific oracles rely on two key mechanisms: an ASO smart contract and an <em>executor</em> oracle. ASO smart contract contains oracle program and custom configuration required by customer for their specific use case. An executor oracle is a generic and complete oracle engine that implements fundamental oracle functionality using a distributed node network and consensus verification. They work together to serve web3 application requests as follows:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>An application smart contract makes a request for an oracle value by calling the ASO smart contract. It provides request parameters (if any) and expects a call back with a response.</li>
                    <li>ASO smart contract combines received parameters with its configuration settings, its oracle program and makes a request to the executor oracle.</li>
                    <li>Request to the executor oracle is picked up by decentralized network of nodes. Each online node runs the oracle program provided by the ASO smart contract. The program queries online data sources, processes received data and performs other programmed operations as needed to produce an oracle value.</li>
                    <li>The produced value is submitted by each node to the executor smart contract for a proof-of-stake consensus verification. Upon reaching the configured threshold, the executor contract calls back ASO smart contract with the response. The ASO smart contract forwards the response to the application smart contract.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Gora provides common shared executors on a number of popular public blockchain networks. ASO customers just starting out are advised to use these. When data privacy, extra computing power or control over staking tokenomics is desired, customers are welcome to setup their own executors using Gora software. ASO smart contract can switch executors at any time.</p>

                <h3>Creating and managing ASO's</h3>
                <p>Gora application-specific oracles are normally created and updated using Gora's web-based <em>ASO control panel</em>. It provides a user-friendly way to handle all aspects of ASO's, including compiling oracle programs and testing them.</p>
                <figure align="left">
                    <img width="850" alt="Gora web-based control panel in ASO architecture" src="aso_managing.svg" />
                </figure>
                <p>To start using Gora ASO control panel, go to <a href="https://aso.gora.io/">https://aso.gora.io/</a> and connect your Web3 wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet". If you already created ASO's using the account selected in your wallet, you will be able to choose one from the drop-down list. You will also see a "Create new" button clicking which will make a new ASO for you.</p>
                <aside class="warning"><strong>WARNING</strong> Creating or updating ASO's on a public mainnet generates blockchain transactions that cost real money. For trying things out free of charge, we suggest using a public testnet, such as Base Sepolia. Before doing that, ensure your wallet account has some testnet ETH which you can get via a public web faucet for the chosen network.</aside>
                <p>Once you create a new ASO by clicking "Create new" button or select an existing one in the dropdown list, you will be presented with the ASO control panel. It contains properties of the currenty selected ASO for you to edit.</p>
                <aside class="warning"><strong>WARNING</strong> ASO configuration property values are stored on the blockchain, so the larger they are the more it will cost. Do not populate them if you don't need them. For example, Oracle program source code property is for customer information only and should generally be left empty on a mainnet.</aside>
                <p>Control panel entry fields and their meanings are as follows:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>ASO contract</dt>
                    <dd>Address of the ASO contract being configured</dd>
                    <dt>Description</dt>
                    <dd>Short string describing the ASO, e.g. "Footbal player rating"</dd>
                    <dt>Own fee</dt>
                    <dd>Amount in blockchain native currency that must be paid by the calling smart contract to make a request to the ASO, e.g. <code>0.0012</code>.</dd>
                    <dt>Executor</dt>
                    <dd>Address of the executor oracle smart contract for the ASO to use. This should default to Gora shared executor address on this blockchain. A customer using their own custom executor will need to enter its address here.</dd>
                    <dt>Maxium executor fee</dt>
                    <dd>Highest amount that the ASO is allowed to pay for an executor oracle request. Executor request price is defined by the executor and can be fixed or varying to accomodate for market volatility. Empty field means no limit. Setting maximum executor fee allows to prevent ASO losing money: if the executor fee goes higher, ASO will decline requests. Every executor will also set the asset in which it will be paid - an ERC20 token or native currency. This asset will be auto-detected by the ASO, so it does not need to be configured here.</dd>
                    <dt>Source code</dt>
                    <dd>Source code for the oracle program - piece of software that queries data sources and produces an oracle value. This field is for <em>for customer reference only</em> and is not used by ASO. It may be best to leave it empty on mainnet blockchain networks for privacy and cost saving. Its primary purpose is convenience while developing on public testnets or local blockchain networks.</dd>
                    <dt>Compiled binary</dt>
                    <dd>Oracle program in compiled (binary form). This field can be populated compiling source code in the above field by pressing "Compile" button.

                <h3>Oracle programs</h3>
                <p>An ASO oracle program is a compact piece of software that queries online data sources and produces an oracle value. Any ASO must have an oracle program to function, and usually it is written specifically for this ASO. While Gora ASO programs can be written in any language that compiles to Web Assembly, the ASO control panel and documentation examples use C language. It is simple, ubiquitous and can create very compact executables suitable for storage on the blockchain.</p>
                <section id="entering-and-compiling">
                    <h4>Entering and compiling</h4>
                    <p>No software installation is required to work with oracle programs. They can be written, compiled, tested and deployed inside ASO web control panel. To get started, click "Insert example" button in the control panel for a newly created ASO. The field (which must be empty) will be filled with a basic C program that returns string <code>"Hello Gora!"</code> as the oracle value. Clicking "Compile" button will compile this program and populate the compiled binary field.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="testing">
                    <h4>Testing</h4>
                    <p>ASO contol panel allows to test oracle programs before they are deployed to the blockchain. Pressing "Test locally" button will trigger compilation (when source code is present) and execution of the current oracle program. Click it to run the test and check out the result placed in the "Log messages" box. For programs that take arguments, they can be provided "Program arguments (JSON)" field as a JSON-formatted array. In a production environment, these arguments would come from <code>args</code> parameter of the <code>request()</code> method call to ASO smart contract.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="api">
                    <h4>API</h4>
                    <p>Oracle programs interact with the host node via <em>Gora off-Chain API</em>. It is essentially a customized Web Assembly environment that provides functionality to query data sources, fetch results, write log messages and more. A key part of this API is support for repeated program execution in the context of the same oracle request. This is necessary because Web Assembly programs cannot efficiently pause while waiting for asynchronous operations, such as receiving data from online sources.</p>

                    <p>Gora off-chain API is made available to C programs by including <code>gora_off_chain.h</code> header file. When compiling via ASO control panel, it is made available for inclusion automatically. It defines the following custom functions:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><code>void gora_request_url(const char* url, const char* value_specs)</code></dt>
                        <dd>Request content from an URL. <code>value_specs</code> argument contains one or more <a href="#value-extraction">value extraction specifications</a>, separated by tab characters.</dd>
                        <dt><code>void gora_set_next_url_param(const char* value)</code></dt>
                        <dd>Set value of a template parameter in the URL most recently requested with <code>gora_request_url()</code>. For example, after calling <code>gora_request_url("https://example.com/?a=##&amp;b=##")</code>, one can call <code>gora_set_next_url_param("one")</code>, then <code>gora_set_next_url_param("two")</code> which would result in URL <code>"https://example.com/?a=one&amp;b=two"</code> being requested. This allows having predefined templates for data source URLs and filling them at runtime.</dd>
                        <dt><code>void gora_log(const char* message, const int level)</code></dt>
                        <dd>Write a message to the node log. Intended for debugging only, oracle program logging is disabled by default on production nodes.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>In addition to functions, Gora off-Chain API defines a <em>context</em> data structure. It is designed for passing data from host node to oracle program as well as preserving current state between execution <em>stages</em> (more on that later). An instance of this structure is passed to oracle program whenever it executes. It contains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>API version information for compatibility checks</li>
                        <li>Arguments passed to the program with the oracle request</li>
                        <li>Values from queried data sources extracted by host for the program</li>
                        <li>Oracle value to be returned, set by the program</li>
                        <li>Current execution stage number</li>
                        <li>Scratch memory for program data to persist between execution stages</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Complete definition of the context structure is contained in <code>gora_off_chain.h</code> header file which all oracle program developers are advised to peruse.</p>
                    <section id="staged-execution">
                        <h5>Staged execution</h5>
                        <p>Execution of oracle programs in stages is necessary because, like most low-level system languages, Web Assembly does not support asynchronous calls. When a Web Assembly program needs to retrieve data from a source that cannot return it instantly (e.g. a network endpoint), it has to either constantly check for data arrival in a loop (very inefficient) or rely on runtime environment to call it when the data is ready. Gora off-chain API implements a variant of the second approach.</p>
                        <p>Gora host node executes the program repeatedly, performing asynchronous operations between executions which are called <em>stages</em>. A <em>stage</em> starts when program's <em>main function</em> is called by the host node and ends when this function returns. During a stage, the program can schedule HTTP(S) requests, possibly using URL templates that it can fill at run time. When a stage ends, these requests are executed by the host node. On their completion, next stage commences.</p>
                        <p>Request results are made available to the program via the context structure. The context contains current stage number, so program always knows which stage it is at. It also has persistent memory space to share data between stages. Finishing a stage, the program's main function returns a value telling the host node what to do next: execute the next stage, finish successfully or terminate with a specific error code. For a hands-on primer of using staged execution, please see example programs.</p>

                <h3>Using ASO's</h3>
                <p>Gora app-specific oracles work using a simple callback pattern. To make an oracle request, customer smart contract calls ASO smart contract's <code>request</code> method. If parameters need to be passed to the oracle program, they are supplied as the method argument (array of byte strings). Unique request ID is returned by ASO for future reference. On successful request completion, customer smart contract gets a response call to its special <code>__goraAsoResponse</code> method from the same ASO smart contract. The call has two arguments: request ID to match the response to the initiated request, and the actual value returned by the oracle.</p>
                <p>To get a feel of it, consider the following contrived Solidity fragment that might occur in a smart contract tracking Bitcoin price and DowJones Industrial Average index:</p>

                <h3>Executor oracles</h3>
                <p>Every ASO relies on an executor oracle (<em>executor</em>) for basic lower-level blockchain oracle operations. Separating ASO's and executors allows for more flexibility, failover capabilities and a seamless customer upgrade path from shared to private infrastructure. Gora recommends new ASO customers to start with a shared executor.</p>

                    <h4>Shared executors</h4>
                    <p>Gora provides shared executors for ASO customer use. These are essentially generic oracles relying on a decentralized network of nodes for data querying and validation. Node operators use Gora tokens to make stakes for proof-of-stake valudation and to receive rewards for fulfilling oracle requests. Customers using a shared Gora executor must therefore fund their ASO smart contract with Gora tokens and maintain their balance as they are being spent.</p>
                    <p>To use a Gora shared executor, set your ASO executor address according to network being used:</p>

                    <h4>Custom executors</h4>
                    <p>Shared executors rely on distributed networks of nodes run by general public. This may not be suitable for certain use cases. For example, when private data (such as keys) is used for querying data sources, or when oracle programs use exceptionally large amounts of computing resources.</p>
                    <p>For these kinds of situations, Gora provides a way for customers to deploy their own executors. Once customer deploys an executor smart contract, they can bring up a separate node network under their own management. Standard Gora software which can work with private authentication keys can be used to run it, or Gora can customize its node software for customer's specific needs.</p>
                    <p>At this time, creating custom executors is a semi-manual process, with a completely automated tool being on the roadmap. If you would like to explore this option, please contact Gora.</p>

                <h3>Requesting oracle data</h3>
                <p>Gora functionality is accessed by calling <em>methods</em> of Gora <em>main smart contract</em>. To get started, you need Gora main contract address for the blockchain network that you are going to use. The preferred way to find it is to check the home page of Gora Explorer for the network in question. For example, <a href="https://mainnet.base.explorer.gora.io/">Gora Explorer for Base mainnet</a>. Gora main contract address is shown next to "Gora App" label.</p>
                <p>With Gora main contract address, you can create a Gora API Solidity object in your smart contract and start making Gora calls. For example, read total amount of tokens currently staked in this Gora network:</p>

                    <dd>Specifies the data source and method to access it. It has the structure of a standard URL, e.g. <cite>http://some-source.example.com/some_data.json</cite>. Besides HTTP(S), request URLs may use Gora-specific access protocols. For example, <cite>gora://classic/1</cite> specifies test source that always returns <cite>1</cite>, without querying external endpoints.</dd>
                    <dt>Data source parameter</dt>
                    <dd>For sources that are not <em>special</em> (i.e. do not begin with <code>gora://</code>) this parameter contains a <a href="#value-extraction">value extraction specification</a>. It describes how oracle-returned value is to be extracted from data provided by the source. For example, with a JSON endpoint that returns <code>{ "score": 123
}</code> one would specify: <code>jsonpath:$.score</code>. Gora supports a number of value extraction options which will be explained in detail below. Special Gora sources will be described separately.</dd>

                </figure>
                <p>For use cases that require more flexibility, Gora supports oracle requests that execute user-supplied <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Web Assembly</a> to produce an oracle value. This enables querying of data sources determined at runtime and processing their outputs in arbitrary ways. The user-supplied code is executed off-chain by Gora nodes and is subject to resource limits.</p>
                <p>To make use of this feature, developers write their off-chain programs utilizing Gora off-chain API. Any language that compiles to Web Assembly may be used. We recommend C language due to its simplicity and ubiquity, and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang compiler</a> because of it can generate Web Assembly binaries directly. E.g.:</p>
                <pre class="terminal">$ clang example.c -Os --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm -c -o example.wasm</pre>
                <p>Compiled binary is then encoded as <cite>Base64Url</cite> (URL-safe variant of Base64) and included with the request to a special URL defined by Gora to handle off-chain computation requests. In simpler form, where web assembly executable binary is provided in smart contract source code, this URL has the following format: <code>gora://offchain/v&lt;API version&gt;/basic?body=&lt;Base64Url-encoded WASM binary&gt;[optional positional arguments]</code>.</p>
                <p>The executable body can also be supplied in binary form as the <em>data source parameter</em>. Which is more convenient for larger executables or automated builds. In that case, the <code>body</code> data source URL parameter is omitted.</p>
                <p>Current Gora offchain API version is <code>0</code>. So, for example, to execute your program with two positional arguments (<code>"red"</code> and <code>"apple"</code>) you would specify the following URL: <code>gora://offchain/v0/basic?arg=red&amp;arg=apple&amp;body=AGFzbQEAAAABhoCAg...</code></p>
                <p>To convert binaries into Base64URL encoding, you can use <code>basenc</code> command-line utility, normally included with Linux and MacOs:</p>
                <pre class="terminal">$ basenc --base64url example.wasm

                <p>To reduce blockchain storage use, you can apply Gzip compression before encoding:</p>
                <pre class="terminal">gzip &lt; example.wasm | basenc --base64url</pre>
                <p>Gora will automatically recognize and decompress gzipped Web Assembly binaries.</p>

                <h3>Gora off-chain computation API</h3>
                <p>Web Assembly programs supplied with off-chain computation requests interact with host Gora nodes via a simple API. It provides functions to setup and initiate HTTP(s) requests, or write log messages. It also includes a persistent data structure to share data with the host node or between <em>steps</em> of your program. <em>Steps</em> are essentially repeated executions of the program in course of serving the same off-chain computation request. They are necessary because Web Assembly programs cannot efficiently pause while waiting to receive data from external sources such as network connections.</p>
                <p>A <em>step</em> starts when the program's <em>main function</em> is called by the executing Gora node and ends when this function returns. During a step, the program can schedule HTTP(S) requests, possibly using URL templates that it can fill at run time. When the step ends, these requests are executed by the Gora node. On their completion, the next step commences and your program can access request results as well as other data provided by the Gora node via current <em>context</em> structure. The <em>context</em> persists for the duration of executing your off-chain computation request. Finishing a step, the program returns a value which tells the Gora node what to do next: execute another step, finish successfully or terminate with a specific error code.</p>
                <p>For the list of valid return values, see <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/blob/main/gora_off_chain.h">gora_off_chain.h</a>. header file.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Solidity compiler (<code>solc</code> binary). Used to compile examples and potentially developer's own code.</li>
                            <li>Geth EVM node software (<code>geth</code> binary). Provides local blockchain functionality to model master (L1) and slave (L2) EVM networks. Both instances of Geth are run in development mode (with <code>--dev</code> switch). Hardhat is not used because it has shown issues with multiple concurrent connections and was lagging behind recent Ethereum forks feature-wise.</li>
                            <li>Gora smart contracts (files with <code>.compiled</code> extension), already compiled into combined JSON format.</li>

                    <p><code>start_dev_env</code> script starts Geth instance, deploys Gora smart contracts and stays in the foreground, displaying log messages from the above as they come. Contrary to Gora Developer Quick Start package for Algorand, it must be running at all times to run Gora smart contracts locally. There is no way to start a Gora node or its local blockchain on-demand on per-example basis. To end your development session and terminate the script, hit Ctrl-C in the terminal window running it.</p>

                    <h4>Encoding request specification</h4>
                    <p>A request specification is an instance of a structured <a href="https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0004">Algorand ABI type</a>. The exact ABI type depends on the type of oracle request being specified, but it is always supplied to the request method encoded as a byte string. This allows Gora to add new request types without changing its smart contracts.</p>
                    <p>Currently Gora supports three request types:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type #1 - classic requests, querying sources predefined by Gora</li>
                            <li>Type #2 - general URL requests, for arbitrary URLs and advanced data extraction methods</li>
                            <li>Type #3 - off-chain computation requests</li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>At the highest level of Algorand ABI type definition, all of these types have the following structure:</p>
                    <p><code>tuple(source_spec[], aggregation, user_data)</code>.</p>
                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>source_spec[]</code> - array of source specifications. A single oracle request can query multiple sources.</li>
                            <li><code>aggregation: uint32</code> - how results from the sources are aggregated (<code>0</code> - no aggregation, <code>1</code> - maximum, <code>2</code> - minimum, <code>3</code> - average).</li>
                            <li><code>user_data: byte[]</code> - any user-supplied data to attach to request and its response</li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>A a source specification is a structured Algorand ABI type instance that describes an oracle source query. Its exact ABI type depends on the request type and is described below.</p>

                    <p>Available sources and arguments applicable to them can be examined by running: <code>gora dev-sources</code>. The list of classic sources is defined by Gora is subject to extension in future releases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Parametrized sources</strong></p>
                    <p>To add flexibility to classic requests, certain source properties can be specified on per-query basis.</p>
                    <p>For example, if a source provides many pieces of data from the same endpoint, it is more convenient to let the requester specify the ones they want than to define a separate source for each. This is achieved by <em>parametrizing</em> <code>value_path</code> property. Setting it to <code>##0</code> in the oracle source definition will make Gora nodes take its value from 0'th argument of the request being served. Parameter placeholders can just as well be placed inside strings where they will be substituted, e.g. <code>http://example.com/##2&amp;a=123</code>.</p>
                    <p>The following oracle source definition properties can be parametrized: <code>url</code>, <code>value_path</code>, <code>timestamp_path</code>, <code>value_type</code>, <code>value</code>, <code>round_to</code>, <code>gateway</code>. <em>Substituted values are always treated as strings</em>. For example, when supplying a parameter to set <code>round_to</code> field to <code>5</code>, the string <code>"5"</code> must be used rather than numeric value of <code>5</code>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Third-party authentication</strong></p>
                    <p>General URL requests support using third party services to access sources that require authentication. For example, a price data feeds provider may protect their paid endpoints by requiring an access key (password) in URLs. Since everything stored by the blockchain is public, authentication keys cannot be held by smart contracts or included in oracle requests. Node operators may configure their own access keys for some sources, but not in the general case. Third-party authentication services that issue one-time authentication keys on per-request basis are designed to fill that gap. When <cite>auth_url</cite> field in the source specification is filled, Node Runner software will call this URL and receive a temporary auth key. The authenticator service will check that the node runner and the oracle request are both eligible to receive it.</p>

                    <p>To make use of this feature the developer must write their program using Gora Off-Chain API in any language that compiles to Web Assembly. Compiled binary is then made available to Gora network nodes in one of the three ways: verbatim as a request parameter (for small programs), in on-chain box storage or as a download at a public URL.</p>

                    <p>To get a grasp of Gora Off-Chain API and execution model, start with this example program: <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/blob/main/example_off_chain_basic.c">example_off_chain_basic.c</a>. It returns the phrase "Hello world!" as an oracle value and is self-explanatory. To compile it, install <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang C compiler</a> version 12 or newer and run:</p>
                    <pre class="terminal">clang example_off_chain_basic.c -Os --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm -c -o example_off_chain_basic.wasm</pre>
                    <p>For a more advanced example, featuring URL requests and asynchronous operations, see: <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/blob/main/example_off_chain_multi_step.c">example_off_chain_multi_step.c</a>.</p>
                    <p>This program does useful work and is extensively commented. It takes a British postcode as a parameter, queries two data sources, building their URLs dynamically, and returns current air temperature in the area of said postcode. This requires two data-retrival operations: getting postcode geographical coordinates and querying current weather at them.</p>
                    <p>Because of certain limitations of Web Assembly, programs cannot efficiently pause while waiting to receive data from extrnal sources such as URLs. To work around that, Gora off-chain programs are run in <em>steps</em>. Steps are essentially repeated executions of the program with a shared context that includes current execution number. A <em>step</em> starts when the program's <em>main function</em> is called by the executing node and ends when it returns.</p>
                    <p>During a step, the program can schedule HTTP(S) requests, possibly using URL templates that it can fill at run time. When the step ends, these requests are executed by the Gora node and on their completion, the next step commences. The program can access request results as well as other node-provided data such as the number of step currently executing via data structure passed to it as an argument.</p>
                    <p>Finishing a step, the program always returns a value which tells the Gora node what to do next: execute another step, finish successfully or terminate with a specific error code. For the list of valid return values, see <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/blob/main/gora_off_chain.h">gora_off_chain.h</a> header file.</p>
                    <p>To compile this example program, run: <code>`
clang example_off_chain_multi_step.c -Os --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm -c -o example_off_chain_multi_step.wasm
`</code></p>
                    <p>To execute the compiled binary using Gora CLI and default test destination app, run: <code>`
gora request --off-chain ./off_chain_example.wasm --args sm14hp
`</code></p>

                    <h4>Multi-value requests and responses</h4>
                    <p>This feature allows requests of type 1 and 2 to fetch multiple pieces of data from the same source response. Normally, <code>value_path</code> property contains a single expression, so just one value is returned by an oracle request. To return multiple values, it is possible to specify multiple expressions separated by tab character. For example: <code>$.date\t$.time\t$.details.name</code>. Since an oracle return value must be a single byte string for the consensus to work, returned pieces of data are packed into Algorand ABI type - an array of strings:</p>

                    <p>To access individual results, smart contract handling the oracle response must unpack this ABI type. <em>N*th string in the array will correspond to the *n*th expression in the ``valuePath`` field. **Important:*</em> all returned pieces of data in such responses are stringified, including numbers. For example, number <code>9183</code> will be returned as ASCII string <code>"9183"</code>. Smart contract code handling the response must make the necessary conversions.</p>

                    <h4>Rounding numeric response values</h4>
                    <p>Certain kinds of data, such as cryptocurrency exchange rates, are so volatile that different Gora nodes are likely to get slightly different results despite querying them at almost the same time. To achieve consensus between nodes when using such sources, Gora can round queried values. A source that supports rounding will have "Round to digits" field when shown with <code>gora dev-sources</code> command. Usually, the rounding setting will be parametrized, for example: "Round to digits: ##3". This means that the number of significant digits to round to is supplied in parameter with index 3. The <em>number must be provided in string representation</em>, like all parameters. Rounding will only affect the fractional part of the rounded number, all integer digits are always preserved. For example, if rounding parameter is set to "7", the number <code>123890.7251</code> will be rounded to 123890.7, but the number <code>98765430</code> will remain unaffected.</p>

                    <p>Results of an oracle request are returned by calling <code>dest_method</code> method of the smart contract specified in <code>dest_id</code>. The method gets passed the following two arguments:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>type: uint32</code> - response type; currently is always <code>1</code>.</li>
                            <li><code>body: byte[]</code> - encoded body of the response (details below).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The <code>body</code> argument contains an ABI-encoded tuple of the following structure:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>byte[]</code> - request ID. Currently the same as Algorand transaction ID of the <code>request</code> smart contract call that initiated the request.</li>
                            <li><code>address</code> - address of the account making the request</li>
                            <li><code>byte[]</code> - oracle return value, more details below</li>
                            <li><code>byte[]</code> - data specified in <code>userData</code> field of the request</li>
                            <li><code>uint32</code> - result error code, see below</li>
                            <li><code>uint64</code> - bit field with bits corresponding to the request sources; if n'th bit is set, the n'th source has failed to yield a valid value.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>0</code> - normal result.</li>
                            <li><code>1</code> - result was truncated because it was over the allowed size. Result size limit is configured in Node Runner software and depends on maximum smart contract arguments size supported by Algorand.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Unless the numeric type has been explicitly specified for the return value, it will be encoded as a string. If value expression is a JSON path that matches an object, it will stringified, e.g. <code>'{ "date": "01-01-2020", "price": 123 }'</code>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Numeric oracle return values</strong></p>
                    <p>When returned oracle value is a number, it is encoded into a 17-byte array. <code>0</code>'s byte encodes value type:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>0</code> - empty value (not-a-number, NaN)</li>
                            <li><code>1</code> - positive number</li>
                            <li><code>2</code> - negative number</li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Bytes <code>1 - 8</code> contain the integer part, <code>9 - 17</code> - the decimal fraction part, as big endian uint64's.</p>
                    <p>For example, <code>0x021000000000000000ff00000000000000</code> in memory order (first byte has 0 offset) decodes as <code>-16.255</code></p>

                <h3>Troubleshooting applications</h3>
                <p>Troubleshooting Gora applications begins with making oracle requests and looking at how they are handled in each processing phase. For that, we recommend using Gora CLI tool, a Gora observer node and <a href="https://app.dappflow.org/explorer/home">Algorand Dapp Flow</a> web app. The rest of this section will walk you through setting them up and using them to trace execution of a Gora request.</p>
                <section id="observer-node">
                    <h4>Observer node</h4>
                    <p>Gora observer node is a node set up and running on a Gora network for the purpose of monitoring requests. An observer node is not required to run continuously or have any GORA tokens staked. When using <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/">Developer Quick Start</a>, setting up an observer node is not necessary because it includes a full Gora node. Refer to the documentation at the above link for details. For troubleshooting applications on Algorand testnet or mainnet, if you are not already running a normal Gora node on the same network, set on up following the Getting Started section above.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="checking-that-your-application-is-making-request-calls">
                    <h4>Checking that your application is making request calls</h4>
                    <p>Now you can find out Algorand address of the application from which you are making Gora requests. This can be done with <a href="https://app.dappflow.org/explorer/home">Algorand Dapp Flow Explorer</a>: enter your application ID into the search box and press Enter which should take you to application transactions page. The address should be displayed under "Application account" label.</p>
                    <p>Make sure you have set up your observer node as its configuration is used by Gora CLI tool. Now run the tool to find out Gora main smart contract ID:</p>
                    <pre class="terminal">$ gora info</pre>
                    <p>You should get output containing a string like:</p>
                    <pre class="terminal">Main app ID: 439550742</pre>
                    <p>Now you can use Dapp Flow to check that oracle request calls are being made from your application to correct Gora smart contract. Try running your app, then search on Dapp Flow for transactions to Gora main app ID. There must be an application call transaction from your app address just made.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="monitoring-how-your-requests-are-processed">
                    <h4>Monitoring how your requests are processed</h4>
                    <p>Once your Gora request call gets stored on the blockchain, it is up for detection and processing by Gora nodes. That including your observer node, which you will now utilize to monitor processing of your requests. If you are not using <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/">Developer Quick Start</a>, you will need to enable debug output on your node. Open your node config file (<code>~/.gora</code> by default) and under <code>"deployment"</code> section add the following lines:</p>
                    <p><code>"logLevel": 5</code></p>
                    <p>Make sure to add a comma to the previous line if there is one or you will get a config syntax error when trying to start the node. Restart the node if it is already running.</p>
                    <p>If your observer node hasn't been running, start it now and keep an eye on its log messages: either by running it in the foreground or by tailing logs with <code>docker logs -f &lt;node container name&gt;</code>.</p>
                    <p>Now when your Gora blockchain app makes another request, you should see your node pick up the request and log detailed messages on various phases of its processing. For example, with a General URL request:</p>

                    <p>If you see log messages with the <code>INFO</code> prefix, but none with <code>DEBUG</code>, then you have not enabled debug logging and need to ensure that you have followed the instructions in the beginning of this section properly. When running an observer node with no stake, it is normal not to see messages after "Using seed...".</p>
                    <p>Issues with Gora customer applications often crop up at this stage. These are most frequently caused by errors in Gora request encoding or data source specification.</p>
                    <p>In case of incorrectly encoded request, the node will fail to decode the request correctly and log an error message beginning with <code>Error parsing request...</code>. Make sure you are encoding the request ABI type properly, consulting examples in <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/">Developer Quick Start</a> if necessary.</p>
                    <p>For problems with data sources, examine log messages after <code>Querying....</code>. If there are no errors reported, check debug messages carefully to make sure that data source URLs queried are correct, the content returned is valid and data extraction expressions are matching it as intended. Currently nodes have no way of explicitly reporting failures to customer smart contracts and will simply return an empty result in most scenarios.</p>

                    <h4>Diagnosing issues with destination application</h4>
                    <p>The last phase of processing where a Gora request can fail starts when node voting concludes in consensus and a call is made to the destination smart contract. This may happen because customer's destination app is either specified incorrectly or fails during processing of Gora response.</p>
                    <p>The destination call is always initiated by just one Gora node. In multi-node Gora networks, it is not possible to reliably predict which one it will be, so one cannot rely on node logs in the this (most common) scenario. The recommended way of debugging such issues is using <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/">Developer Quick Start</a>. It provides a local development network with a single node, making the destination call logs always available.</p>
                    <p>If your application is failing at this stage, examine the error folllowing <code>Calling "voting#...</code> message in your local development node logs. An error occuring inside your destination application will be reported in typical Algorand smart contract error format. Bear in mind, that the destination call is made in an inner transaction inside Gora voting smart contract and interpret TEAL source context accordingly.</p>
                    <p>To mininize risks of making error in repsonse handling, we recommend using Gora Python library available as a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gora/">PIP package</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Setting up your Gora development environment for Algorand</h4>
                    <p>There are four essential pieces to a Gora Algorand development environment:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An Algorand node providing local simulated Algorand network</li>
                            <li>Algorand Python libraries for smart contracts and blockchain APIs</li>
                            <li>Deployed Gora smart contracts</li>
                            <li>A Gora development-only node running and connected to the above</li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The following Algorand software must be installed and functioning:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/algorand/sandbox">Algorand Sandbox</a>.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/algorand-devrel/beaker">Algorand Beaker framework</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Refer to documentation at the above links for download and installation instructions. If using a different package to setup your Algorand node, such as AlgoKit, find out its Algod API connection port number and have it handy. If it differs from <cite>4001</cite>, you will need to enter it during setup of Gora software.</p>
                    <aside class="warning"><strong>WARNING!</strong> By default, Algorand Sandbox runs its local network automatically confirming new transactions on time period basis. This is currently the recommended mode for Gora app development. The "dev" mode of Algorand Sandbox which confirms every transaction instantly and places it in its own round is not currently supported. It is incompatible with security mechanisms of Gora smart contracts.</aside>
                    <p>To install and configure Gora software for your development environment, run <cite>python3 setup.py</cite> and follow the prompts. Gora tools will be downloaded and config files created for you automatically in the checkout directory.</p>
                    <aside class="warning"><strong>WARNING!</strong> Do NOT follow normal Gora node setup process.</aside>
                    <p>When the above script finishes, you will have Gora smart contracts deployed to local network in your Algorand Sandbox install and a Gora node set up for them. This will form a local development-only single-node Gora network necessary to serve your locally tested applications.</p>
                    <p>For local oracle requests to be served, your development Gora node must be running whenever they are made. There are two ways to ensure this. One is to run it temporarily from a script that executes your application test cycle. This is what example apps in this repository do; details can be gleaned from their source code. Another way is to run the node continuously for the duration of your development session. To start it with output to the terminal, change to the checkout directory and run: <code>GORA_CONFIG_FILE=./.gora ./gora_cli docker-start</code>. To make it run in the background, add <code>--background</code> switch to the above command; to see node's log messages, run <code>docker logs gora-nr-dev</code>.</p>
                    <aside class="warning"><strong>WARNING!</strong> Do not add more nodes with non-zero stakes to this setup. It can break oracle consensus and stop request processing.*</aside>

                    <h4>Example applications</h4>
                    <p>This repository includes several example <a href="https://pyteal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PyTeal</a> applications demonstrating the use of Gora oracle. They will be considered below in the order of complexity. Example apps are built with Algorand's <a href="https://algorand-devrel.github.io/beaker/html/index.html">Beaker framework</a> and are commented to make them accessible for novice developers.</p>

Waiting for for oracle return value (up to 10 seconds)
Received oracle value: 1.0</pre>
                    <p>Note the last line: <code>Received oracle value: 1.0</code>. It shows the value returned by the oracle which has been successfully processed and stored by the executed app. If your Gora development node is already running, the date-prefixed log messages above will be found in its output rather than in script's output above. Let us now look at example apps in more detail.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Basic example: <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/blob/main/example_const.py">example_const.py</a></dt>
                        <dd>Demonstrates the use of Gora in most simple and detailed way. It makes a query to a special built-in test source which always returns the value of <code>1</code>. The request is prepared without using Gora support libary, to make the process more explicit. Since no external sources are queried, this example can even be run offline.</dd>
                        <dt>Classic example: <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/blob/main/example_classic.py">example_classic.py</a></dt>
                        <dd>Demonstrates the use of Gora with predefined data sources. These sources are pre-configured under fixed numeric ID's, with more of them potentially being added in future releases. This and following examples use Gora Python library to simplify oracle request building. This is the recommended approach for production use. The classic example queries two currency rates and returns the maximum of the these. The source #7 is queried in both cases, but different sources can be used just as well. Source #7 uses a paid data provider that requires authentication. It is enabled by specifying <code>##signKey</code> as the second source parameter which makes Gora nodes generate a temporary <em>signature key</em> bound to the request and the node. The data source server being queried will check the validity of the request and the node's stake on the blockchain. This allows opening a data source to Gora users only without requiring them to provide authentication data or exposing it on the blockchain.</dd>
                        <dt>General URL example: <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/blob/main/example_url.py">example_url.py</a></dt>
                        <dd>Shows how to use Gora for fetching data from arbitrary URLs. Data from URL responses can be extracted with a variety of methods such as JSONPath, XPath, regular expressions, or substring specifications. Two key differences from the previous example are the request parameters and dummy method calls. The latter is necessary for increasing op code budget of the request transaction, to accomodate the needs of more the flexible request type. To issue such requests with more URLs, you may need to add more <code>do_nothing_N()</code> dummy methods and increase 4th parameter of <code>run_demo_app()</code> to raise op code budget even more.</dd>
                        <dt>Off-chain computation example: <a href="https://github.com/GoraNetwork/developer-quick-start/blob/main/example_off_chain.py">example_off_chain.py</a></dt>
                        <dd>Demonstrates Gora's arbitrary off-chain computation capability. It takes a UK postal code, geolocates it via third-party free API, then queries another free API and returns current air temperature at the location. The C source code accomplishing this can be found in <code>example_off_chain_multi_step.c</code>. The WebAssembly resulting from compilation of this code is included in the example app verbatim, as a byte string constant. For more off-chain executable specification options as well as other details on the off-chain computation feature, refer to Gora off-chain API documentation.</dd>

            <p>Gora is a <em>decentralized</em> blockchain oracle. To produce its values, it relies on a network of independent blockchain-connected nodes running <em>Gora Node Runner (GNR)</em>. Gora token issuance and distribution, required to bootstrap consensus verification, are usually done once by the network owner and are beyond the scope of this discussion. For the purposes of this document, setting up a Gora node network comes down to setting up GNR for each node operator.</p>
            <p>The GNR is distributed as a Linux-based <a href="https://docker.io/">Docker</a> image that runs on any docker-enabled customer host or in Amazon cloud as an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a> application. GNR is managed via <a href="https://download.gora.io/">Gora CLI tool</a> - a self-contained command-line executable that encapsulates all required functionality for Gora node operators or power users.</p>
            <section id="prerequisites">
                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <p>To become a Gora node operator, one should possess the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to work with command-line (CLI) tools and Linux OS in general. Advanced customization may require editing of text files in JSON format. If you are not comfortable with the above, it is recommended that you enlist professional help or get up to speed using resources widely available online.</li>
                    <li>A 64-bit x86 Linux host with <a href="https://docker.io/">Docker</a> installed, or an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> account. Gora software is not thoroughly tested on Mac OS at this time, but some users reported success with Linux instrucitons, so others are welcome to follow them at their own risk.</li>
                    <li>Access to a live API node for each blockchain network they are going to support. Gora serves multiple blockchains, so access options vary per chain. Some are listed in Appendix 1 at the end of this document. In any case, you can run a blockchain node yourself which many Gora node operators do.</li>
                    <li>A funded blockchain account with a wallet connected to it for each supported blockchain network. It is used for opting into Gora applications, receiving Gora tokens and staking them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Updating or moving installations</h3>
                <p>Gora CLI tool is updated with <code>gora update</code> command. It checks whether there is a more recent version than the one being run, and if so, offers to upgrade it by downloading and replacing the <code>gora</code> binary. Current binary will be backed up. GNR is distributed as a docker image, so it will be automatically updated whenever your Gora node is started. To ensure that you are running the latest version, simply stop and start your node again.</p>
                <p>Your can move your Gora installation to a new server without setting it up from scratch. Copy the <code>gora</code> binary to a new location of your choice and <code>~/.gora</code> configuration file to your home directory on the new server. Make sure you have Docker installed and enabled for the user that runs Gora node on the new server as well. When you start your node for the first time at the new location, it may take some time to fetch the GNR docker image. Make sure not to run multiple nodes off the same configuration at the same time.</p>

                <h3>Gora node configuration</h3>
                <p>A Gora node configuration is defined by the blockchain accounts it is linked to as well as various customizations via configuration variables. These are set during the initialization process described above and usually do not need to change. But for basic troubleshooting or developer customization purposes, here is an overview.</p>
                <p>Gora config file contains settings specific to your Gora node in JSON format. When deploying a node to cloud or launching it locally, Gora CLI tool reads this file and passes its contents to GNR via Docker container environment settings. This makes local configuration available to GNR without using docker mounts. The default location of Gora config file is <code>~/.gora</code>.</p>

                <p>An optional rounding modifier is used to round floating-point values to certain amount of digits after the point. This may be necessary with some types of values such as cryptocurrency exchange rates. They can be so volatile that different Gora nodes are likely to get slightly different results despite querying them at almost the same time. That would prevent the nodes from achieving consensus and confirming the value as authentic. Adequate rounding gets us around this issue.</p>
                <p>For instance, if you specify <code>jsonpath:$.rate:3</code>, the responses <code>{ "rate":
1.2344 }</code> and <code>{ "rate": 1.2342 }</code> that may be received by different Gora nodes will yield the same value <code>"1.234"</code>. The nodes will achieve consensus and you will get <code>"1.234"</code> as the resulting oracle value. Rounding only affects fractional part of the rounded number, all whole part digits are preserved. For example, if rounding parameter is set to <code>4</code>, the number <code>1.12345</code> will be rounded to <code>1.1234</code>; but, for exmaple, the number <code>12345678</code> will remain unaffected.</p>

            <h2>Legacy documentation (Litepaper)</h2>
            <section id="introduction-1">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Gora aims to accelerate the development of dApps that are useful in the day to day lives of millions of users. Gora will accomplish this by providing the infrastructure necessary for developers and organizations to build applications that make use of real world, off-chain data. Furthermore, Gora will enable developers to build applications that utilize off-chain computation.</p>
                <p>In 2022, the number of daily users for decentralized applications surpassed 2.4 million daily users, with several billion dollars in volume. Global uncertainty has lead to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially in emerging markets. This increased adoption of cryptocurrencies has familiarized people with wallets and the mechanics of transacting on-chain. As the general population becomes more comfortable using decentralized applications, demand for oracles to provide real world data will see a similar rise.</p>
                <p>Along with record numbers of new users, the blockchain space has also seen record number of hacks and exploits, many of these being through bridges/oracles hacks and manipulation. This highlights the need for security as a top priority for any oracle solution such as Gora.</p>
                <p>The primary goal of this litepaper is to highlight the organization and backers of Gora, and to highlight compliance of the protocol. In addition, it will aim to provide a high level overview of the functioning mechanism of the oracle, and the types of feeds Gora plans to launch with. This litepaper is accompanied by an in-depth economic design paper. Technical details of the network will be released in a future whitepaper closer to the launch date of the protocol.</p>

            <section id="the-gora-vision">
                <h3>The Gora Vision</h3>
                <p>The Gora vision is to deliver an Oracle solution that brings mainstream adoption to web3, and empower an ecosystem of decentralized applications to solve real-world user problems.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to advance the state-of-the-art in oracle and blockchain reliability, safety, and performance by providing a flexible and modular oracle architecture. This architecture should support frequent upgrades, fast adoption of the latest technology advancements, and first-class support for new and emerging use cases.</p>
                <p>We envision a decentralized, secure, and scalable network governed and operated by the community that uses it. When infrastructure demands grow, the computational resources of the oracle network scale up horizontally and vertically to meet those needs. As new use cases and technological advances arise, the network should frequently and seamlessly upgrade without interrupting users. Infrastructure concerns should fade into the background, and security should be guaranteed without trading off privacy or decentralization.</p>
                <p>To achieve this Gora will:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hire and partner with highly skilled computer scientists, cryptographers, mathematicians and statisticians, data scientists and more</li>
                        <li>Build a modular application that allows development and upgrades of specific modules</li>
                        <li>Work with 2-3 audit firms to review Gora's Code</li>
                        <li>Perform millions of simulations that model the trajectory of the token based on starting parameters</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
                <section id="layer-1-vs-layer-2">
                    <h4>Layer 1 vs Layer 2</h4>
                    <p>Oracle services tend to generally build out co-chains or blockchains to be able to handle requests, and then interface onto one or more blockchains. While this method allows for growth beyond a single blockchain, the technical infrastructure required is greater than building specifically for a single blockchain.</p>
                    <p>When designing Gora, we made the intentional choice to focus on building an independent network. Therefore, GoraNetwork may be categorized as a Layer-2 network, with a distributed set of nodes. This means a much faster time to market, and a greater focus on security by reducing the number of attack vectors than building GoraNetwork as a Layer 1 network. This does not limit GoraNetwork, as the distributed nodes can interface with other blockchains as necessary.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="true-decentralization">
                    <h4>True Decentralization</h4>
                    <p>Another consideration in the level of decentralization (aka permission to participate). Although GoraNetwork is not in and of itself a blockchain, it is very similar in that it is a distributed system of nodes and data providers, working together to affect the blockchain state - and as such, a level of permission, if any, needs to be determined.</p>
                    <p>On one spectrum, an permissioned Oracle service can require knowledge the feed provider is, and only a select number of these known feed providers to submit feeds. On the other end of the spectrum, a permissionless service will neither require nor care who signs up to provide feeds.</p>
                    <p>In their article “When Permissioned Blockchains Deliver More Decentralization Than Permissionless” (Bakos et al.)[1], the authors make a compelling argument that “while distributed architectures may enable open access and decentralized control, they do not preordain these outcomes…permissionless access may result in essentially centralized control, while permissioned systems may be able to better support decentralized control”. What this means is just because a system is built to be decentralized and distributed, it will take time to get there, largely due to malicious forces or large actors with economies of scale taking over at before the network is able to achieve network effects.</p>
                    <p>The Gora team believes that decentralizing as much as possible is essential but agrees with the authors above that some form of permission is necessary, especially at the beginning. This is implemented via a deposit mechanism, where Node runners must stake and deposit a certain amount of network tokens to participate. This raises the barrier to entry, with the goal being to make being a malicious actor or a poor-quality provider as unattractive as possible. Furthermore, aggregated data feeds will allow community members to vote in or vote out feed providers. This way, only feed providers that are institutional and can guarantee high quality data are allowed to participate (unless the community decides otherwise).</p>
                </section>
                <section id="the-oracle-problem">
                    <h4>The Oracle Problem</h4>
                    <p>The oracle problem, at its core, means having to trust an entity in a world that should be considered trustless. It could be argued that the only real solution to this problem would be to conduct all activities that an oracle provides onto the blockchain. For example, if ALGOs were only ever exchanged for USDC on-chain, and USDC was only ever spent by individuals on chain, the exchange price of USDC/Algo may be determined on the blockchain, hence solving the oracle problem. However, basketball cannot be played on the blockchain, nor does the blockchain have a weather system.</p>
                    <p>One possible solution might be having everyone watching the game input the score on the blockchain, but what if the loser of a match has more fans, and feel like they deserved a penalty? With the advent of social media, coordinated social ‘spamming’ a system can and does go viral such as the ‘Bum rush the charts’ campaign to influence iTunes charts[2], or meme-fueled GameStop buying frenzy meant mainly to bankrupt large hedge funds[3].</p>
                    <p>By such definitions, the oracle problem may be considered unsolvable. While a detailed analysis of the oracle problem is outside the scope of this document, an alternative to such a strict definition is that as long as data is sourced from multiple reliable sources, and poor quality or malicious participants stand to lose much more than they gain (in addition to having a high cost barrier to entry), the system should remain secure. In fact, almost all major blockchains are designed as such.</p>
